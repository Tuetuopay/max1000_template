# MAX1000 Template

Howdy!

Here you may find a template Quartus II project for the Arrow/Trenz FPGA dev
board MAX1000. This is a rather nice board, but somehow lacking documentation.

## What do I get?

This contains a fully featured Quartus II project, complete with pin assignments
and naming, along with clock config and sample top module.

## TODO

- Makefile to build from the CLI and avoid the Quartus GUI altogether
- Integrate some docs with pinouts, etc
- Figure out how to #@&! reset registers

## Licence
